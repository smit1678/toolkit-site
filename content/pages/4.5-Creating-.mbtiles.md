title : 4.5 Creating .mbtiles
---
MBTiles (.mbtiles) is the file format used for storing map tiles as a single file - the most common use case as baselayers for mobile mapping applications. There are multiple tools to create mbtiles, with selection based on baselayer type (aerial imagery), addition of vector layers, file size, zoom, etc.

### HOT Export Tool
[HOT Export Tool](https://export.hotosm.org/en/v3/) allows users to download OSM data by specifying tags, area of interest, and file type. Learning resources and walkthroughs can be found at the [HOT Export Tool Learn page](https://export.hotosm.org/en/v3/learn).

**Tools and Technology Needed:**

* Computer
* Internet Connection
* OSM Account

See [Data Export Tools](https://github.com/hotosm/toolbox/wiki/6.-Data-Export-Tools) for more information and training materials on using the HOT Export Tool. 

### TileMill
TileMill is an offline, downloadable application used to create mbtiles. TileMill allows for vector layers to be inserted into mbtiles (i.e. assignment area shapefiles, roads). 

Workflow for creation tiles with aerial imagery and vector layers can be found [here].

**Tools and Technology Needed:**

* Computer
* Internet Connection
* Optional: .shp files for vector layering

### Tile Huria
[Tile Huria](https://www.tilehuria.org/index) is a simple tool for creating mbtiles based on an area provided via Geojson format with aerial imagery. 

**Tools and Technology Needed:**

* Computer
* Internet Connection
* .geojson file for area of interest
