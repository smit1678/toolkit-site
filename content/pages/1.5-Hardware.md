## Mobile data collection: smartphones

**When planning to use OpenDataKit:**

Most any Android smartphone will do, as long as it has a relativy modern Android version (4.1+).

**When planning to use OpenMapKit:**

To enable OpenMapKit to run fluently and be able to handle larger background maps (in 'mbtiles' format) and OSM data, please make sure that phones have:
* At least 1.5, but preferably 2 GB of RAM
* Preferably 16 GB of storage
* A modern Android version (6.0+)

Furthermore, the following are recommended:
* A 5" screen for usability
* A decently sized battery. For extended usage, it may be necessary to have battery packs
* Make sure to have enough charging options, such as car chargers and extension cords

The following phones/models have been verified to work well on various projects:

Smartphones:

* Tecno Camon C9 (2 GB RAM)
* Tecno L9 (2 GB RAM, 16 GB storage)
* Huawei Y5 (2017) and Huawei Y6 Pro (2 GB RAM, 16 GB storage)
* Sony Experia L1 (2 GB RAM, 16 GB storage)
* Motorola Moto G5 (2 GB RAM, 16 GB storage)

Tablets:

* Samsung Tab A (SM-T285, 7", 2016) (1.5 GB RAM, 8GB storage)

**Considerations for Hardware Management in Mapping Activities**
* Create and have all mapping participants sign an agreement for the responsibility and liability of devices 
* Create an equipment sign out log
