Creating an atlas in QGIS allows users to create a series of maps for geographic regions with a set template. This atlas template allows for a large number of maps to be generated for areas of interest, such as districts, wards, and other administrative areas, with the same style and layout. 

**HOT Project Examples:**

* [Ramani Huria](http://ramanihuria.org/data/) (Dar es Salaam, Tanzania)
* LEGIT (Liberia)
