## Form design

**Creating ODK forms** 


Forms can be created using spreadsheet software (such as Excel or [LibreCalc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/)) or using the [ODK Form Builder](https://build.opendatakit.org/). Documentation on how to design a form can be found [here](http://xlsform.org/en/).

**Creating OMK forms** <br>
Forms for OMK are slightly altered from ODK forms to incorporate the OSM tagging scheme and need to be built using spreadsheet software (such as Excel or [LibreCalc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/)). In addition to the structure of an ODK form, OMK forms require an additional 'osm' tab that alters the form structure for OMK. Documentation on how to design a form can be found [here](http://openmapkit.org/docs_odkformsforomk.html).

## Form conversion
After forms are developed, they need to be converted from .xlsx/.xls to .xml to be used by the ODK application. This can be done by using [XLSform](https://docs.opendatakit.org/xlsform/) [online](https://opendatakit.org/xlsform/) or [offline](https://docs.opendatakit.org/xlsform/).

## Set-up
Once forms are converted, [follow these instructions](https://github.com/hotosm/toolbox/wiki/1.5.1-Setting-up-phones-and-servers) for mobile device set-up.
