title : 1.8 Trainings and Workshops
---
This is a brief overview of considerations and resources to use while planning trainings and workshops for mapping and OSM. 

**Attendee requirements**  
Requirements for attendees will vary depending on the scope of the trainings, the intended participants, and the available resources. No matter the scope of the training, it is important to communicate these requirements BEFORE the training so that participants can come prepared. 
  
Some attendee requirements may include:

* Have a laptop and mouse.
* Be computer literate with basic computer skills.
* Have enthusiasm and willingness to collaborate with others.
* Attendeeâ€™s computers should have sufficient free disk space (approx 10GB) and attendees should have administrator rights so that they can install software on their computers.
* Attendees should have a PDF document viewer installed on their computers.

**Workshop venue requirements**  

* Wi-Fi Capability
  * If the venue can provide Wi-Fi, confirm with the venue managers that the Wi-Fi has enough capacity for the number of attendees expected to show. For example, if you expect 10-15 people to show up to your event, the Wi-Fi will need to be capable of hosting 15-20 internet connections - remember, you will need to connect as well!
  * If there are no venues with wi-fi capability, consider the option of using a Mi-fi device or other Hotspot options
* Space, tables, and chairs to provide for your expected attendance.
* Enough power outlets for charging laptops and other devices.
  * If this is limited, you'll need to consider power strips and extension cables.
* Generator/electricity access for duration of workshop.
