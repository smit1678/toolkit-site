The [HOT Tasking Manager](https://tasks.hotosm.org/) is a mapping tool designed and built for the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team's collaborative mapping process in OpenStreetMap. The purpose of the tool is to divide up a mapping project into smaller tasks that can be completed rapidly with many people working on the same overall area. It shows which areas need to be mapped and which areas need the mapping validated.

Note: To become a project manager send an email to info@hotosm.org and they will make sure you get set up.
