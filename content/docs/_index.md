# HOT Toolbox

This wiki is designed to provide HOT teams and OSM Communities with a repository of HOT Training Materials and a guide to the large amount of resources that already exist for the various components of mapping projects, from software guides to running mapathons.

Many pages in this wiki will contain Training Materials produced by HOT. These materials are uploaded under CC by 4.0 which means they are free to use and be modified - we simply ask that you credit HOT and maintain a Creative Commons License. Learn more about Creative Commons and free use here.
