There is no one way to collect data in the field and it will vary by context – but the following steps cover the essential steps you should take.  

**1. Coordinate with the local administration of the area you will be mapping** 
<br>  This entails identifying and contacting partner organisations working locally in the area that you are planning to map. Contacting these can be done via email, however, a letter or document detailing your intent weighs much more.<br>

**2. Obtain authorization from district and other officials**
<br>It's important to inform and get authorization from district officials. Write to the appropriate local official, copying relevant district-level authorities. Once you receive a letter of authorization, copy it to have on hand and distribute to higher-level authorities to make them aware of your project.<br>
 
**3. Prepare relevant field data collection tools and guides**
<br>To collect good data. you need to employ a well-defined data model. A data model reflects the information you want to capture. After establishing a solid data model, it is important to create logical Field Data Collection Forms that capture the data you are looking for in the best way. <br>

**4. Recruit mappers**
<br>Mappers will in most cases be drawn from community members, students or partner organisation staff.

**5. Train mappers**
<br>It is useful to create a training schedule. Usually two days are enough time to cover data collection and discuss the community’s needs. This is also an opportunity to select your field mappers. <br>

**6. Find transportation** 
Motorbike riders provide a much-needed element of local knowledge, complementing the actual field mappers.  Work with mappers or local partners and stakeholders to recruit local transportation<br>

**7. Field Mapping map guides (maps production)**
<br>Strategically organize and subdivide the area to be mapped. Using QGIS, prepare relevant guide maps that mappers will use in the field.

**8. Field mapping – guide participants during data collection**
<br>Mappers should be well equipped with mobile phones having all the relevant tools and accessories to facilitate field mapping. Mappers move to the field with a mission order for their safety and comfort operating in these communities.
Mapped data is sent to the server.

**9. Field Data Cleaning and upload to OSM**
<br>Following the field data cleaning workflow, all collected data is cleaned and uploaded to OSM. Reviewing the data before upload ensures that the quality is good before it is shared. 

**10. Schedule follow-up at a later date**
<br>It is good to meet after field data collection activities to review the challenges faced in the field. This could take the form of a mapathon.
